# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition

This Git repository contains some problems worked from SICP's 2nd edition
using MIT/GNU Scheme and Edwin.

### Opinion

- SICP seems to require some mathematical rigor.
  For example, having to figure out the equivalent form for a double-application
  of a Fibonacci calculation iteration is a little bit much for an introductory-level
  class... (e.g. I would not be able to do this if I was 12, etc.) I feel like some
  of the problems might be too difficult for an incoming freshman. (Opinion!)
   - The book was written with MIT students in mind, so never mind.
